# Machine Ethics: A Tutorial for Prospective Researchers

Machine ethics is a multi-disciplinary effort focused on enabling ethical behavior from machines towards people and (in a sense) towards other machines. This tutorial aims to present the state of the art in machine ethics, helping researchers enter this field or reflect critically on the ethical dimensions of their own work.

**Presenters:**
- **Marija Slavkovik**, University of Bergen, Norway, Email: [marija.slavkovik@uib.no](mailto:marija.slavkovik@uib.no)
- **Louise Dennis**, University of Manchester, Email: [louise.dennis@manchester.ac.uk](mailto:louise.dennis@manchester.ac.uk)
- **Kevin Baum**, German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI), Germany, Email: [kevin.baum@dfki.de](mailto:kevin.baum@dfki.de)


**Duration:**
[Half a day, divided into two 1:45h slots, at Day 2](https://ijcai24.org/tutorials/).

**Outline:**
1. **Introduction to Machine Ethics**

2. **Ethically Relevant Information**nformation.

3. **Incorporating Ethics in Operation**

4. **Ensuring Ethical Behaviour**

5. **Current and Future Trends**

**Target Audience:**
Researchers at all levels with a basic graduate-level understanding of artificial intelligence, interested in engaging with machine ethics research.

**Motivation:**
The field of machine ethics addresses critical AI problems and is increasingly relevant as the autonomy of computational agents and systems grows.
