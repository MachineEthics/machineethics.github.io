Machine ethics is a multi-disciplinary effort focused on enabling ethical behavior from machines towards people and (in a sense) towards other machines. This tutorial aims to present the state of the art in machine ethics, helping researchers enter this field or reflect critically on the ethical dimensions of their own work.



**Duration:**
Half a day, divided into two 1:45h slots, at Day 2 -- [for more information, check here.](https://ijcai24.org/tutorials/).

**Outline:**
1. Introduction to the research problems of machine ethics, its history and what do different disciplines study

2. On ethically relevant informationnformation.

3. Incorporating ethics in operation; state of the art, approaches, methods, implementations

4. Ensuring ethical behaviour

5. Current and future trends of machine ethics research. Resources and challenges.

**Target Audience:**
Researchers at all levels with a basic graduate-level understanding of artificial intelligence, interested in engaging with machine ethics research.


**Presenters:**
[Marija Slavkovik](https://slavkovik.com/) is full professor at the _University of Bergen_ in Norway. Her [area of research](https://scholar.google.de/citations?hl=de&user=TVmqPq0AAAAJ) is Artificial Intelligence (AI) with expertese in collective reasoning. Slavkovik is active in the AI subdisciplines of: multi-agent systems, machine ethics and computational social choice. She has been doing research in machine ethics since 2012, in particular on formalising ethical decision-making. Email: [marija.slavkovik@uib.no](mailto:marija.slavkovik@uib.no)
