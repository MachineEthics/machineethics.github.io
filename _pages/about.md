# Machine Ethics: A Tutorial for Prospective Researchers

Machine ethics is a multi-disciplinary effort focused on enabling ethical behavior from machines towards people and (in a sense) towards other machines. This tutorial aims to present the state of the art in machine ethics, helping researchers enter this field or reflect critically on the ethical dimensions of their own work.

**Presenters:**
- [**Marija Slavkovik**](https://scholar.google.de/citations?hl=de&user=TVmqPq0AAAAJ), University of Bergen, Norway, Email: [marija.slavkovik@uib.no](mailto:marija.slavkovik@uib.no)

**Duration:**
Half a day, divided into two 1:45h slots, at Day 2 -- [for more information, check here.](https://ijcai24.org/tutorials/).

**Outline:**
1. Introduction to the research problems of machine ethics, its history and what do different disciplines study

2. On ethically relevant informationnformation.

3. Incorporating ethics in operation; state of the art, approaches, methods, implementations

4. Ensuring ethical behaviour

5. Current and future trends of machine ethics research. Resources and challenges.

**Target Audience:**
Researchers at all levels with a basic graduate-level understanding of artificial intelligence, interested in engaging with machine ethics research.

**Motivation:**
The field of machine ethics addresses critical AI problems and is increasingly relevant as the autonomy of computational agents and systems grows.
